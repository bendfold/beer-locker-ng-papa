# Angular beer locker
I just want to use the REST API I set up from the beer locker and try to put an Angular driven front end on top of it.

As a means of trying to keep the Angular side of things tidy I have tried to adhere to [John Papas style guide], using his [modular project] as a basis for the structure.
