The REST API for this project is based upon a tutorial writen by [Scott Smith][rest-tutorial].

After completing the REST API, I decided to put an Angular driven front end on top of it.

As a means of trying to keep the Angular side of things tidy I have tried to adhere to [John Papas style guide], using his [modular project] as a basis for the structure.
